 ## Model background
An adaptation of the standard SIR epidemiological model will be applied to attempt to model the general patterns of misinformation spread. Parameters for the adapted model will then be estimated from a real-world misinformation dataset and the model outcomes compared to the real-world data values to estimate the accuracy of the model.
